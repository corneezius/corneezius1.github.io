<p>Fluttr Develeopment
The development of our app is characterized into the following phases.</p>

<p>The following provides marketing rollout for each PHASE. PHASES aren’t describe in full here yet, but will do shortly. For any new PHASES that are floated add descriptions &amp; marketing rollout descriptions</p>

<p>PHASE 1
Release to founding team; play and iterate log-in functionalities
PHASE 2: FLOAT
Founding team populates the platform with ideas over a week’s time.
At the conclusion of that time period, first class of (10) CREATIVE ANALYSTS are authorized to continue populating the platform with ideas and evaluating ideas
After a week’s time, we release to (10) of our funders
After another week or so,  each team member selects five friends/family members to recruit to the platform to use
Release to 50 funders a week over three weeks to slowly build capacity
By the time we get to the point in development where we are releasing to funders, our software should support user ability to FLOAT ideas to users that may not be on the platform (with their e-mail). By doing so, we can allow the membership to rise organically.</p>

<p>PHASE 3: DEVELOPMENT &amp; PARTNERSHIPS
All of the items essential to PHASE 3 building;
Figuring out Timed Campaigns
Organizing Microtasks
Expanding Sample Sizes for Ideas based on popularity…
(Will generally require more detailed discussion)</p>

<p>At this phase though, we’ll be ready to push it to the limits and release full product. However, we need to make sure we have enough developers to continue hammering out glitches and building new features</p>

<p>{Possible events below are to be organized simultaneously]
§  Idea Competition sponsored by VFA
§  Penn Apps
§  General Idea Competition targeted at UPENN Campus
§  General Idea Competition targeted at Columbia’s campus
§  As many media outlets as possible so we can start building brand recognition, post that we’ve been featured in as many publications as possible (Maybe Ernest can help)</p>
