							<div class="people_bio">Joy (Ting Zhang) is a rising sophomore at Penn. She is from Guangzhou, China. She likes to complain that no one knows about Guangzhou even though it is the third biggest city in China, and also elaborates on its amazing food -- dim sum, you all know it.<br><br>
							At Penn she is involved in theatre arts, participating in cultural events, engaging in community service, doing public speaking advising, playing Frisbee, or talking about life with friends. She enjoys exploring new things, learning about differences, and meeting people from all over the world. PennWorld is not only for her but for all Penn Quakers. PennWorld "is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."</div>

							<div class="people_bio">John Doner is a Californian at heart, and still despises East Coast weather and doesn't understand why sandwiches in Philly are called "hoagies." "It must be a cultural thing," he says.<br><br>
							When John asked Joy what on earth she needed his website expertise for, he was initially astounded at the idea of PennWorld. He simply couldn't believe that such a project was possible. And now, he is proud to have built up the site (even with all its bugs, quirks, and redundancies).<br><br>
							Outside of teh Internetz, he is a second year nursing student also studying health services management at the Wharton School. He enjoys volunteering with Alpha Phi Omega, going on road trips with the Penn Band, and making magic happen with Penn Democrats. </div>

   			 <p class="smaller">PennWorld had its humble beginnings in a Hill College House lounge, and has gained various early supporters. We would like to thank Chris Cruz for the original HarvardLunch code, and Ann Zheng and Ian Clayman for completing much of the logo work.
